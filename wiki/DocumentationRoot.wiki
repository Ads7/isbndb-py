== Overview ==
isbndb-py is a Python wrapper for seaching the ISBNdb.com database for bibliographic data on books

== Description ==
The goals of this project are to:

1. allow serches on ISBNdb.comfrom a python script

2. abstract all http and XML out of a users code

3. do the above in a way that feels natural to python users


To accomplish these goals ISBNDb.py has implemented the following:

1. all searches can be done from a function

2. keys for ISBNDb.com are managed by the program, including access counting to avoid limits

3. Error are raised

4. Search results are returned to act like lists

5. individual books can be accessed as raw XML, ElementTrees, or a native python object.


== Installation ==

== Using the ISBNdb.com Services ==
isbndb-py is a wrapper for searching the ISBNdb.com database. Access to that database requires each developer to have one or more "keys". To register for yours, please visit https://isbndb.com/account/create.html to create an account and follow the instructions to obtain your key(s).

=== Using your ISBNdb.com Key with isbndb-py ===
Once you have your key:

  1. Navigate the the folder where you have installed isbndb-py e.g. cd ~/isbndb-py

  2. Within that folder go to the folder called "tests"

  3. In "tests" create a file called ".isbndbkey"

  4. Copy your key in to ".isbndbkey" and save it


isbndb-py will now use this key to access ISBNdb.com
