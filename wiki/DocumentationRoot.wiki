== Overview ==
isbndb-py is a Python wrapper for seaching the ISBNdb.com database for bibliographic data on books

== Description ==


== Using the ISBNdb.com Services ==
isbndb-py is a wrapper for searching the ISBNdb.com database. Access to that database requires each developer to have one or more "keys". To register for yours, please visit https://isbndb.com/account/create.html to create an account and follow the instructions to obtain your key(s).

=== Using your ISBNdb.com Key with isbndb-py ===
Once you have your key:

  1. Navigate the the folder where you have installed isbndb-py e.g. cd ~/isbndb-py

  2. Within that folder go to the folder called "tests"

  3. In "tests" create a file called ".isbndbkey"

  4. Copy your key in to ".isbndbkey" and save it


isbndb-py will now use this key to access ISBNdb.com
