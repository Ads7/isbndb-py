The isbndb module is a python interface to the remote api for book searches
provided by isbndb.com. It allows for quick pythonic access to database without
having to deal with parsing or other annoyances.

I have set a project page up on google code (code.google.com/p/isbndb-py/)
SVN access: http://isbndb-py.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

The google project was set up on 7-30-2006. It is the first public hosting of 
this project.

Requirements
-------------
This module is written and tested for python 2.3.5. Presumably it should work
for all python 2.3 and greater releases. The only other requirement for this
package to work is ElementTree. Many linux distros provide packages, the main
website for ElementTree is: http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm
*I sugges you also look into cElementTree, it provides something like a 200%
 speed-up in my tests.
 
Basic Idea
----------
The isbndb module is written to be as pythonic as possible. There are two
different classes to work with: IsbndbGetter and ResultCursor.  IsbndbGetter
objects return ResultCursor objects.  Initial search conditions are set in
IsbndbGetter, and then passed on to the ResultCursor so the search is the same
when accessing further result pages (Read up on the isbndb api).  ResultCursor
behaves like a python sequence as much as possible. ResultCursor deals pages of
returns (each index holds a sequence).


Stuff (notes etc):
---------------------
--Caching needs to be fixed, turned off.
--Please supply your own key. its easy to get one. the key needs to be the 
  contents of a file in tests called .isbndbkey 
--The lib defaults to a file in the homedir called .isbndbkeys for it keyfile. 
  this should be created to use it. It can be done with the keys api pretty 
  easily. Hopefully better docs and setup scripts coming soon...
--If anyone wants to write some docs it would be great...
--if you send a bugfix and/or modification, please include test_code for it.
--Since the initial authoring of this, isbndb.com has added to thier api. This should still work, but now does not provide full access to the funtionality provided.
