<Summary>"On 15 June 1215, rebel barons forced King John to meet them at Runnymede. They did not trust the King, so he was not allowed to leave until his seal was attached to the charter in front of him." "This was Magna Carta. It was a revolutionary document: never before had royal authority been so fundamentally challenged. Nearly 800 years later, two of the charter's sixty-three clauses are still a ringing expression of freedom for mankind: 'To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay right or justice'. And, 'No free man shall be taken or imprisoned or in any way ruined, except by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law or the land.'" "1215 - The Year of Magna Carta explores what it was like to be alive in that momentous year. Political power struggles are interwoven with other issues - fashion, food, education, medicine, religion, sex. In many areas it was a time of innovation and change. Windmills were erected, spectacles were invented. Dozens of new towns were founded Oxford became the first university in England, and the great cathedrals of Salisbury and Lincoln were built."--BOOK JACKET.</Summary>

<Summary>In the mid-seventies, the Sex Pistols, the most controversial rock-and-roll band ever, erupted out of London, offending everyone from members of Parliament to the rock establishment it sought to unseat. With its raw, anarchic sounds, aura of sex and violence, outrageous behavior, and concerts that frequently degenerated into near-riots, the band changed the rules of rock-and-roll forever. Add to that the early death of band member Sid Vicious, by heroin overdose, and you have all the ingredients for a legend.In January 1978, the Sex Pistols came to the United States for a twelve-day tour, mostly of cities in the Deep South. 12 Days on the Road is an extraordinary moment-by-moment re-creation of that wild adventure by Noel E. Monk, the Sex Pistols' American tour manager, and veteran journalist Jimmy Guterman. Here is a sensational, "explosive chapter in the history of rock" (Booklist) that is also "a touching and improbable tale of innocence and exploitation" (Kirkus Reviews).</Summary>

<Summary>Taking as his text Georges Batailles insight that "only at the extremes is there freedom," critically acclaimed "guerrilla writer" Harold Jaffe documents Batailles aperçu with 15 bone-chilling illustrations. Manson, Starkweather, Speck, Son of Sam, the Night Stalker, Aileen Wuornos, the Unabomber, Dahmer, Bundy, Gacy, Kemper, Kevorkian and Kissinger are not merely present and accounted for, they are rendered into a "reality TV" that youve never seen before. Widely praised as a virtuoso stylist, Jaffe employs a number of narrative stratagems, such as letters, monologues, interviews and "unsituated dialogues" to torque the flattened, cartoon-like serial killers into a potently unnerving third dimension. As in False Positive, Straight Razor, Eros Anti-Eros and Sex for the Millennium, Jaffes "docufictions" are at the same time lucid, intricate, gruesome, infinitely sad, and hilarious. At the end we are left with a profoundly incisive commentary on Americas insatiable consumption of extremity, conveniently masked as moral condemnation.</Summary>

<Summary>Couples dream of mind blowing sex lives. Sex lives filled with excitement, thrills and adventure. But, too often that sex life evades them and they find themselves with a sex life that is routine, predictable, or "in a rut". It's time to get out of the "rut" and have the sex life you've dreamed of. Experience the adventure and excitement of living out your sexual fantasies. In this book, authors David and Beth Carpenter explain their 16 KEYS. KEYS that will help you break out of your routine, allowing you to enjoy an exciting sex life with your partner. To illustrate their KEYS, the authors have included 16 true stories from their own personal sex life. For added benefit to readers, the authors divided their stories so that eight are written by Beth from the female perspective, and eight are written by David from the male perspective. This gives you insight into what your mate may enjoy, desire, or dream of, and what he/she may be thinking or feeling in different sexual situations. From the Publisher The book is presented in two distinctly different sections. The first section focuses on the philosophy and principles with which the authors have built their relationship and sex life. David and Beth take you through their 16 KEYS, one at a time. From SEGMENTATION (Segment Your Sex Life From The Rest of Your Life), to RISK &amp; REWARDS (Certain Rewards Are Worth The Risk), to SET YOUR OWN LIMITS (Set Your Own Limits On What Is Acceptable &amp; Respect Your Mate's Limits), you will finish the 16 KEYS understanding the philosophy behind each. After explaining their 16 KEYS, the authors give you additional FACTS (ex. Spontaneous Is Best) and TIPS (ex. Have Sex In Unusual Places. We'll Bet It Increases Fun, Excitement &amp; Satisfaction) to help add even more excitement and adventure to your sex life. The second section of this book includes personal stories taken from the authors' sex life. Each story was picked and included because it illustrates the use of one or more of the authors' 16 KEYS. You'll read about David's Birthday Surprise (where David decides that the Reward is Worth the Risk - KEY #9), a Male Stripper Gives A Show &amp; Gets A Show (where KEY #3, Inclusion, assures that there are no problems between David and Beth), and 14 other stories that will help you better understand each of the 16 KEYS. These stories will also provide ideas and inspiration for your own sex life and will open your eyes to new possibilities. As you read their book, you'll find David and Beth Carpenter, the authors, to be an interesting couple. Not surprisingly, David and Beth were featured in the June 15, 2005 edition of ForeWord This Week, an electronic newsletter by ForeWord Magazine. The column, called ForePlay, asks "a series of ten fun questions aimed at getting a provocative, inside look at cool people in the industry (publishing)." - from e-mail to publisher by Nancy Sundstrom, ForeWord Magazine</Summary>
