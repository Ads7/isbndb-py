<Summary>Four thousand years ago, amid tragic suffering and death, Job asked the question of the ages: “If a man dies, will he live again?” Since the dawn of history, the subject of death and the afterlife has been the great question of human existence. It&amp;rsquo;s a subject that everyone wonders about. What lies behind the veil of death? Is there really life after death? Is there a place called hell? This small yet power-packed book answers, in a very straightforward, reader-friendly format, all the most-asked questions ordinary people have about death, near-death experiences, cremation, purgatory, hell, heaven, and our future bodies. You&amp;rsquo;ll be amazed at what awaits us beyond the grave.Is There Sex in Heaven? It&amp;rsquo;s a fair question! And so are the rest. Go ahead…flip to the table of contents. Discover another one, two, or fifty-four others that are guaranteed to intrigue you. Questions like: Do those in heaven know what&amp;rsquo;s happening on earth? and Will I see my pets in heaven? Because even if you&amp;rsquo;d rather avoid the topic, death will not avoid you. So fire away! Ask the tough questions, and get the dead-on answers you need. Straightforward and easy to read, 55 Answers to Questions About Life After Death satisfies that nagging, curious voice whispering from the corner of your mind. Story Behind the Book“Three key experiences in my life have come together to make this book a reality. First, as the pastor of a local church for thirteen years, I have had the privilege of visiting people who are facing imminent death, conducting funerals, and ministering to grieving families. During these times people often have probing questions about life after death. Second, due to my interest and writing in the area of Bible prophecy, I am frequently asked questions about the afterlife at conferences and via e-mail. Third, all kinds of books, TV shows, and groups out there today are fostering unbiblical views of life after death. Knowing that this is a subject of universal interest and great confusion, I have a passionate desire to create a user-friendly, clear, straightforward resource to answer all the key questions that people everywhere are asking about life&amp;rsquo;s greatest mystery.”</Summary>

<Summary>This is where the novel has a nervous breakdown. Anna Noon is a twenty-year-old student with a taste for perverse sex involving an enigmatic older man and a ventriloquist's dummy. Anna lives in Aberdeen, Scotland, and her sex life revolves around the ancient stone circles in the region. The sublime grandeur of the stones provides a backdrop against which Anna is able to act out her provocative psychodramas. This is a book about the body in which the carnal is a manifestation of consciousness: a book in which it is virtually impossible to distinguish the ancient from the postmodern. Drawing on literary and continental philosophy, as well as pulp appropriations, 69 Things suggests that schizophrenia may well be the only sane response to capitalism.</Summary>
