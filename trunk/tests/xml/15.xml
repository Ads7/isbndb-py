<Summary>"The categories of 'whore' and "'ctress' have overlapped over centuries. Actresses are assumed to be sexually available and promiscuous, and prostitutes are assumed to perform for their clients. Employing historical biographies as well as interviews with contemporary sex workers, this book compares actresses and prostitutes from Nell Gwynne to Mae West. Ranging from the seventeenth century to the present, Kirsten Pullen offers many new insights to theater historians and scholars of cultural, social and gender studies."--Publisher's description.</Summary>

<Summary>In Acts of Faith, Acts of Love, McGinely explores the overlap of religious and sexual identities in the stories gay men write about themselves. The autobiographical writings of forty gay Catholics (or once Catholics) are analysed. The work is both literary and theological on the premise that experience constitutes one of the four sources of theological reflection, along with scripture, tradition, and reason. "This is an important contribution to the ongoing discussion of the intersection of homosexuality and religion. McGinley presents a scholarly, well-documented discussion of the integration of sexuality and identity, as well as of the theoretical issues of moral agency and narrative form. He complements this discussion with a sensitive exploration of patterns and themes in contemporary autobiographical writings by 40 gay Catholics (or former Catholics)… . This book resounds with the authenticity and integrity of personal narrative and academic critique. Highly recommended.” -Library Journal “Our newspapers and churches are filled with questions about gay rights, same-sex marriage and gay/lesbian adoption. What we may miss is the human face of the debate. In this regard, McGinley has done a great service, assembling and analyzing forty gay Catholic autobiographies. Some excerpts are funny, others heart-breaking; all attempt to save lives. They are acts of courage and sacred texts because they save not only the author, but also other gay Catholics for whom following church teaching ‘led not to virtue but to pathology.’” -Human Development</Summary>

<Summary>The Act of Marriage After 40: Making Love for Life by Tim and Beverly LaHaye with Mike Yorkey is a practical, no-nonsense guidebook that will teach married couples to have a more satisfying sex life in middle age and beyond. A follow-up to their successful Act of Marriage, the topics covered in this book are based on the results of a comprehensive survey investigating the sexual issues that are most important to older Christian couples. Although the LaHayes say their research indicates that "the frequency of sex is reduced by advancing age," they make a convincing case for their belief that "the meaning of the act of marriage can be enriching, more satisfying even with the passage of years." Each chapter of the book explores topics such as menopause, erectile dysfunction, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and the temptation of extramarital affairs. The LaHayes also provide a number of strategies for jump-starting stalled sex lives. Some of these strategies are atmospheric (men will learn that "items that stir a woman's senses are a bouquet of flowers, a bowl of fresh fruit, or 100-gram bars of Swiss chocolate (chocolate has been known for its aphrodisiac qualities for centuries)." Other strategies are more technical. (Various sexual positions are described, and although the LaHayes "do not personally recommend or advocate oral sex," they "see no biblical grounds to preclude two married people from enjoying the practice.") The Act of Marriage is a passionate exploration of an important subject, and its advice will help many married couples practice sexual faithfulness to one another as an expression of Christian faith. --Paul Power</Summary>

<Summary>Over three decades and more than 150 million albums, AC/DC has established itself as much more than just a great rock band. For millions of fans spanning several generations across the world, they are an ear-bleedingly loud, sweat-soaked religion, courtesy of such classic albums as Highway to Hell and Back in Black. Now, in a book of astonishing breadth and scope, comes, for the very first time, the complete story of AC/DC. Everything you ever wanted to know and plenty more you never dreamt of is all here, the ultimate balls-out adventure, laced with sex, drunken escapades and brawls. It's a journey that started in the suburban Sydney, Australia, bedrooms of brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, boys who could wreak havoc with their guitars. Over their power chords were the lyrics and voice of Bon Scott, who would lead them higher and higher—until his tragic death in 1980. The bittersweet irony after his death was that not only did the Youngs manage to hold together without him, but the band's fortunes and status skyrocketed with his replacement, Brian Johnson, and the album Back in Black. Five long years in the making, AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll is sourced from more than 1,300 interviews the band has given over the past thirty years combined with in excess of 75 of the authors' own interviews with those who worked with AC/DC both in the studio and on the road—many of whom have never spoken about the band publicly. It's topped off with stunning, never-before-seen photos to create the ultimate portrait of the ultimate rock band.</Summary>

<Summary>Zoe Reynard has it all. A successful career, a loving husband, three beautiful children, a devoted mother, and the house of her dreams. Most women would kill to be in her shoes. There's just one thing she has that no one else in their right mind would want. A secret addiction that could very well ruin her fairy tale life. Zoe is addicted to sex. Addicted is the story of Zoe, an African-American female arts dealer. It traces her life from the time she first meets her husband, Jason, in the fifth grade, falls in love with him over a game of Twister in the eighth grade, loses her virginity to him in high school and eventually marries him. Everything seems perfect in Zoes life to her friends and family as she secretly deals with serious problems in her marriage. After failing to get Jason to open up to her sexually, Zoe becomes involved in not one, not two but three extramarital affairs. By the time she seeks the aid of a prominent female African-American therapist, the walls of her picture perfect life have already started to crumble. Addicted shifts into high gear as Zoe finds out that everyone from her lovers to her husband to her own mother are hiding secrets of their own. Zoe's best friend, Brina, is physically abused by her alcoholic boyfriend, Dempsey. Meanwhile, Zoe discovers under hypnosis that her fascination with sex stems from she had buried deep in the crevices of her mind years before. Zoe ends up being repetitively stalked and attacked. It all comes to a head on a cold, dark mountain following a trail of murders and the true murderer is anyone's guess. Addicted does for women what Fatal Attraction did for men. It will make a woman think twice before risking it all.</Summary>
