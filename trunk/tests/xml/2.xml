   <Summary>Remember when your mother taught you to never deface a book? Well, forget her advice and rip (literally!) into Laura Corn's 101 Grrreat Quickies. The author of 101 Nights of Grrreat Sex is working her magic again. As she puts it, "You make love. Sometimes slow and passionately. Sometimes all night. And sometimes, on occasion, you've done it quickly, half dressed, in a very special way. You've done a 'Quickie.'" This book contains 101 sealed "coupons" of quickies for you and your lover to tear from the book. Some are "for her to unzip," and some are for him. When the time is right, you present the coupon to your lover, who must immediately stop what he or she is doing in order to do what the coupon indicates. These quickies come with tantalizing names, enticing you to take a look, but as each is "zipped" on all sides, no peeking is allowed. Sit with your partner and choose a coupon to redeem later. How can you resist coupons such as "Call of the Wild," "The Foreplay Gourmet," "A Brush with Lust," and "Passion Fruit"? No need to do these in order--in fact, you may want to build up to the "Laura Corn Challenge." Whether you want to light a fire in an older relationship or are looking to spark some fun in a new one, this book (which promises that nothing is "dangerous, embarrassing, humiliating or requires you to be one of the Flying Wallendas") just may give you the courage to utter these words to your lover: "I want you and I want you right here and right now!"</Summary>

   <Summary>"Is your sex life perfect?" challenges Laura Corn in the introduction to her delightful and unique 101 Nights of Grrreat Sex. If the title, with its guarantee of "grrreat sex twice a week, every week, for one full year!" won't tempt you, the packaging will. Like the cover says, "Go ahead, tear this book up.... please!" Intriguingly packaged, 101 Nights is reminiscent of the book-in-plain-brown-wrapper, except in this case each page is sealed; no peeking! Once a week, according to 101's instructions, each lover picks a sealed page (with scenarios such as "Up Against the Wall," "Angel with a Lariat," "Fire down Below," and "Point of No Return") and tears it out of the book, keeping it a secret. Follow the scenario and, throughout the week, expect any number of erotic surprises. We let life get in the way of love, Laura Corn states, and worries in the way of wonder. At the heart of this book is the assertion that surprise and anticipation rekindle passion: "This is not like some new diet, where you're expected to simply change your lifestyle overnight. Here, you'll learn by doing--slowly, gradually, month by month. And because you're doing it often--every week, remember, for a whole year--you'll actually turn interesting, exhilarating, unpredictable sex into a habit, and not just a special event." There are 50 secret seductions written for his eyes only and 50 written for hers. His seductions begin with playful ways of not just getting her in the mood, but making her breathless with anticipation. Hers begin with the revelation of "Marilyn Monroe's sensual bedroom secret that drove her lovers wild (and caused JFK's toes to curl!)." All it takes is a commitment to play and, well, to tear up the book. 101 Nights does all the rest, including lists of ingredients (massage oil, silk scarf, champagne,etc.) as well as terse tips culled from 54 of the bestselling books in the field. Loaded with recipes for licentious loving, 101 Nights of Grrreat Sex gives lovers permission to sin with the safety of a script and a fun way to palpate the old passion.</Summary>

   <Summary>In this, the sixth book in Brynie's award-winning 101 QUESTIONS... series, the author answers briefly and honestly the best of the questions about sex and sexuality she collected from hundreds of teenagers over more than three years. The questions range from "What is sexuality?" to "How can I know if I have an organsm?" She reviews what scientific studies have revealed about attractiveness and mate selection, homosexuality, masturbation, the brain activity that evokes sexual responses, and more. She presents statistics on teen sexual activity and points out that teens are choosing NOT to have sex more often than ever before. This is a science book, not a book of advice. It tells young readers what they need to know to better understand their sexuality and to make informed choices about it. The book includes an extensive glossary, list of organizations and publications, and index.</Summary>

   <Summary>"On 15 June 1215, rebel barons forced King John to meet them at Runnymede. They did not trust the King, so he was not allowed to leave until his seal was attached to the charter in front of him." "This was Magna Carta. It was a revolutionary document: never before had royal authority been so fundamentally challenged. Nearly 800 years later, two of the charter's sixty-three clauses are still a ringing expression of freedom for mankind: 'To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay right or justice'. And, 'No free man shall be taken or imprisoned or in any way ruined, except by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law or the land.'" "1215 - The Year of Magna Carta explores what it was like to be alive in that momentous year. Political power struggles are interwoven with other issues - fashion, food, education, medicine, religion, sex. In many areas it was a time of innovation and change. Windmills were erected, spectacles were invented. Dozens of new towns were founded Oxford became the first university in England, and the great cathedrals of Salisbury and Lincoln were built."--BOOK JACKET.</Summary>

   <Summary>In the mid-seventies, the Sex Pistols, the most controversial rock-and-roll band ever, erupted out of London, offending everyone from members of Parliament to the rock establishment it sought to unseat. With its raw, anarchic sounds, aura of sex and violence, outrageous behavior, and concerts that frequently degenerated into near-riots, the band changed the rules of rock-and-roll forever. Add to that the early death of band member Sid Vicious, by heroin overdose, and you have all the ingredients for a legend.In January 1978, the Sex Pistols came to the United States for a twelve-day tour, mostly of cities in the Deep South. 12 Days on the Road is an extraordinary moment-by-moment re-creation of that wild adventure by Noel E. Monk, the Sex Pistols' American tour manager, and veteran journalist Jimmy Guterman. Here is a sensational, "explosive chapter in the history of rock" (Booklist) that is also "a touching and improbable tale of innocence and exploitation" (Kirkus Reviews).</Summary>
