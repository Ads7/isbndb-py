<Summary>Dirt cupcake mix, as American as apple pie. Nipple lightener from Japan. Tick juice, indispensable in Venezuela for black magic love rituals. Sunglasses from Zimbabwe with shades cut from plastic juice bottles and no lenses. Korean disposable straw sandals made especially for mourners and corpses. Is this stuff cool or what? But wait--there's more. Flip through this book in search of international weirdness, and it's a pretty sure bet you'll wind up absorbing some sobering information about sex, death, destruction, poverty, and the arrogant ways of multinationals. Under the guise of an ultrahip consumer's guide to the world's nifty stuff--divided into sections labeled "Food," "Fashion," "Animals," "Body," "Soul" and "Leisure"--1000 Extra/Ordinary Objects is a subversive crusader for human rights and ecological awareness. Sure, you can find out how to buy your very own Dom Perignon-flavored sorbet or a CD of "Music for Healthy Pets." But you'll also stumble upon objects like the cute little bright green Russian-made PFM-1 antipersonnel mine, "a favorite toy of generations of Afghan children" punished for their curiosity by a double whammy of liquid explosive and tiny blades. On other pages, seemingly innocuous objects--like the sweetly lumpy doll couples made of tree bark by Elliot Chitungu of Zimbabwe--turn out to have a bitter subtext. (Chitungu, who is gay, makes all his couples heterosexual; in his country, homosexuality is a criminal offense.) Other objects are examples of savvy recycling, like the paper made in Malawi from elephant dung and recycled cardboard. With straightforward descriptions in both English and French, unblinking photographs of young people modeling even the most outré objects, and a Yellow Pages that includes information about little-known charitable organizations worldwide, this is a fun book with a heart of gold. --Cathy Curtis</Summary>

<Summary>For a quarter century, Tim Miller has worked at the intersection of performance, politics, and identity, using his personal experiences to create entertaining but pointed explorations of life as a gay American man—from the perils and joys of sex and relationships to the struggles of political disenfranchisement and artistic censorship. This intimate autobiographical collage of Miller's professional and personal life reveals one of the celebrated creators of a crucial contemporary art form and a tireless advocate for the American dream of political equality for all citizens. Here we have the most complete Miller yet—a raucous collection of his performance scripts, essays, interviews, journal entries, and photographs, as well as his most recent stage piece Us. This volume brings together the personal, communal, and national political strands that interweave through his work from its beginnings and ultimately define Miller's place as a contemporary artist, activist, and gay man.</Summary>

<Summary>Sensational for speech writers, and for social and personal amusement! For some years investors have been asking Mr Dines to publish a compilation of his jokes and bits of wisdom from his speeches, thousands of radio and TV interviews and from The Dines Letter itself. Mr Dines' first joke book has over 60 categories of jokes and here are a dozen free samples: 1) We arrive in the world naked, and we leave the world naked...so stockbrokers are just doing God's work. 2) Always travel first class, because if you don't, your heirs will!. 3) The early bird gets the worm, but it's the second mouse that gets the cheese! 4) Why is divorce so expensive? Because it's worth it. 5) If the world were always logical, men would ride sidesaddle... and women's bikes! 6) The argument with your wife you just won is not over yet...and the man who thinks he's smarter than his wife has a really smart wife! 7) There are many benefits to marriage, such as sex every night...and, if you're lucky, your partner joins in once a month! 8) Somebody asked me why my relatives don't travel to visit and stay with me. My secret is that I borrow from the rich ones and lend to the poor ones...and neither ever comes back! 9) Our leaders' heads are deeper in the sand than armless clam diggers! 10) They say I look "distinguished"... that's the last stage before extinguished. 11) Do you know the difference between broccoli and boogers?...Kids won't eat broccoli! 12) Always persist. Never give up...think of the poor guy who invented "Preparation G"!</Summary>

<Summary>American Independent films have to many observers provided the only experimental and distinctive voices in recent US cinema. Now an increasingly pervasive influence on contemporary European cinema and mainstream Hollywood, a whole generation of innovative and idiosyncratic American film-makers including Steven Soderbergh, Todd Haynes, Hal Hartley and Jim Jarmusch emerged during the critical and commercial renaissance of the late 1980s and 1990s. Jason Wood's guide defines and outlines a personal but representative selection of a hundred recommended American independent films. Listing titles such as 'sex, lies and videotape', 'Blood Simple', 'Pulp Fiction', right up to 'Donnie Darko' each entry includes a plot synopsis, a commentary on the film's significance, production and exhibition history and cross-references to other films. Jason Wood's expert but concise selection, part of the new BFI Screen Guides Series, is an informative map to one of the most vital areas in the contemporary film-making scene.</Summary>
