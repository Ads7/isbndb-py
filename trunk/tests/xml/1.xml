   <Summary>Dirt cupcake mix, as American as apple pie. Nipple lightener from Japan. Tick juice, indispensable in Venezuela for black magic love rituals. Sunglasses from Zimbabwe with shades cut from plastic juice bottles and no lenses. Korean disposable straw sandals made especially for mourners and corpses. Is this stuff cool or what? But wait--there's more. Flip through this book in search of international weirdness, and it's a pretty sure bet you'll wind up absorbing some sobering information about sex, death, destruction, poverty, and the arrogant ways of multinationals. Under the guise of an ultrahip consumer's guide to the world's nifty stuff--divided into sections labeled "Food," "Fashion," "Animals," "Body," "Soul" and "Leisure"--1000 Extra/Ordinary Objects is a subversive crusader for human rights and ecological awareness. Sure, you can find out how to buy your very own Dom Perignon-flavored sorbet or a CD of "Music for Healthy Pets." But you'll also stumble upon objects like the cute little bright green Russian-made PFM-1 antipersonnel mine, "a favorite toy of generations of Afghan children" punished for their curiosity by a double whammy of liquid explosive and tiny blades. On other pages, seemingly innocuous objects--like the sweetly lumpy doll couples made of tree bark by Elliot Chitungu of Zimbabwe--turn out to have a bitter subtext. (Chitungu, who is gay, makes all his couples heterosexual; in his country, homosexuality is a criminal offense.) Other objects are examples of savvy recycling, like the paper made in Malawi from elephant dung and recycled cardboard. With straightforward descriptions in both English and French, unblinking photographs of young people modeling even the most outr√© objects, and a Yellow Pages that includes information about little-known charitable organizations worldwide, this is a fun book with a heart of gold. --Cathy Curtis</Summary>

   <Summary>Sensational for speech writers, and for social and personal amusement! For some years investors have been asking Mr Dines to publish a compilation of his jokes and bits of wisdom from his speeches, thousands of radio and TV interviews and from The Dines Letter itself. Mr Dines' first joke book has over 60 categories of jokes and here are a dozen free samples: 1) We arrive in the world naked, and we leave the world naked...so stockbrokers are just doing God's work. 2) Always travel first class, because if you don't, your heirs will!. 3) The early bird gets the worm, but it's the second mouse that gets the cheese! 4) Why is divorce so expensive? Because it's worth it. 5) If the world were always logical, men would ride sidesaddle... and women's bikes! 6) The argument with your wife you just won is not over yet...and the man who thinks he's smarter than his wife has a really smart wife! 7) There are many benefits to marriage, such as sex every night...and, if you're lucky, your partner joins in once a month! 8) Somebody asked me why my relatives don't travel to visit and stay with me. My secret is that I borrow from the rich ones and lend to the poor ones...and neither ever comes back! 9) Our leaders' heads are deeper in the sand than armless clam diggers! 10) They say I look "distinguished"... that's the last stage before extinguished. 11) Do you know the difference between broccoli and boogers?...Kids won't eat broccoli! 12) Always persist. Never give up...think of the poor guy who invented "Preparation G"!</Summary>

   <Summary>American Independent films have to many observers provided the only experimental and distinctive voices in recent US cinema. Now an increasingly pervasive influence on contemporary European cinema and mainstream Hollywood, a whole generation of innovative and idiosyncratic American film-makers including Steven Soderbergh, Todd Haynes, Hal Hartley and Jim Jarmusch emerged during the critical and commercial renaissance of the late 1980s and 1990s. Jason Wood's guide defines and outlines a personal but representative selection of a hundred recommended American independent films. Listing titles such as 'sex, lies and videotape', 'Blood Simple', 'Pulp Fiction', right up to 'Donnie Darko' each entry includes a plot synopsis, a commentary on the film's significance, production and exhibition history and cross-references to other films. Jason Wood's expert but concise selection, part of the new BFI Screen Guides Series, is an informative map to one of the most vital areas in the contemporary film-making scene.</Summary>

   <Summary>"There's evil in the world."¬óGeorge W. BushAnd lots of it. The question is, just what does it look like? A politician? An ex-girlfriend? Your landlord? Your boss? Hanna Arendt said it was banal. The Red Sox think of the Yankees. And in this hilarious, disturbing, quirky, and brilliant little book, noted illustrators Nicholas Blechman and Christoph Niemann present a catalog of their own misanthropic imaginings. The two met in 1997, when Blechman was art director for the New York Times Op-ed Page and Niemann, now a frequent contributor to the New Yorker, had just started working in New York City. As their personal and professional friendship began, they found themselves spending countless nights together in Brooklyn bars, drawing up images¬ówry, comic, arch, painful¬óto represent the sex affairs and political scandals, acts of terror and acts of war that were the news.This professional work led to a personal passion, and so the illustrators chose to draw a small series on rosier subjects like maps and love. But as the world around them grew darker, they decided to explore the other end of the emotional spectrum and devote themselves to evil. 100% Evil is the result: a thoughtful, comical, and¬óat times¬ójoyful book that just goes to show that sometimes it's good to be bad.</Summary>

   <Summary>An instant blockbuster in Italy where it has sold over 700,000 copies, and now an international literary phenomenon, 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed is the fictionalized memoir of Melissa P., a Sicilian teenager whose quest for love rapidly devolves into a shocking journey of sexual discovery. Melissa begins her diary a virgin, but a stormy affair at the age of fourteen leads her to regard sex as a means of self-discovery, and for the next two years she plunges into a succession of encounters with various partners, male and female, her age and much older, some met through schoolmates, others through newspaper ads and Internet chat rooms. In graphic detail she describes her entry into a Dante-esque underworld of eroticism, where she willingly participates in group sex and sadomasochism, as well as casual pickups. Melissa's secret life is concealed from family and friends, revealed only in her diary entries. Told with disarming candor, Melissa P.'s bittersweet tour of extreme desires is as poignant as it is titillating. One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed is a stunning erotic debut, a Story of O for our times.</Summary>
