<Summary>201 Questions to Ask Your KidsDo you have trouble talking to your kids?Does a successful conversation with your child consist of one-word responses or abrupt physical acknowledgments?Does your son or daughter get upset at the most innocent questions?Join the club.Unfortunately, communicating well with kids is something every parent desires but few achieve. We love our children, but talking to them in a meaningful manner isn't always easy. The questions in this book are designed to help. No matter what age or sex your children, no matter how many children you have, no matter how good or bad your current parent/child relationship, this simple "game" will get your family talking more. And when you're talking--really talking about emotions and fears and attitudes--you'll be learning about each other as individuals and growing closer together as a group.An Introduction For KidsWouldn't it be fun to find out more about what your father or mother was like when he or she was a kid? Or get to tell your parents which of their friends you think looks dorkiest? Wouldn't conversation be more interesting if you and your family traded unexpected questions and answers at dinner rather than just talked about what homework did or didn't get done?There are a lot of great things to talk about that no one ever brings up because we usually think conversation is serious rather than a way of being playful. Of course, conversation should be about serious things some of the time--some of the questions in this book are about very serious topics. But other times, questions should be asked just to create new ways to think about things, look back on our lives, or imagine what life would be like if we could design in any way we wanted. In fact, I wrote this book because I think talking can be terrific fun, and even talking to your parents and brothers or sisters can be a kind of great game. Everyone can get to know each other and laugh a lot--and be amazed from time to time. No one wins or loses, but there is an element of surprise in finding out personal information about parents--and sharing some of your ideas, daydreams, and opinions with them.My idea is to think of some of the world's most interesting questions that parents and kids could talk about and give everyone the chance to pick the ones they'd like to hear about. Each person picks a question to ask and then answers a question when his or her turn comes around. All you have to do is choose from the list under 201 Questions to Ask Your Parents and ask any question you want. Your parents can take as long or as short a time they want to answer. Any you can all discuss the topic if you like. But then they go into their section of the book and ask you questions. Some of them might not be so interesting, but others--like asking you who is the meanest kid you know--might be cool to think about and share with them. They'll learn a lot about what you think are ways kids act nasty!You can wiggle out of any two questions that don't interest you or are embarrassing--but no more than that. It's good if a question makes you squirm a little; that means you either haven't thought about it before, or you have but you haven't wanted to deal with it. But why not try out and answer? Pick a set length of time to play for--and my guess is you'll want to extend it. These questions get addictive! You can play them at the dinner table, or after dinner, or on a car trip, or anytime you feel like hearing what your parents say about something.So, this is a book about how to have intesting and often funny conversations with your family. It's a way to avoid dead, boring silences and fill the time instead with questions and answers that everyone will enjoy thinking about. I know that in my family, it is too easy for us to get stuck talking about praqctical things like who has to be taken where the next day. That isn't particularly fun. It doesn't let me in on what my kides are thinking, and it doesn't help my two teenagers learn things that might help them understand me a little better.An ingenious book that speaks to both parents and their kids. 201 QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR KIDS/201 QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR PARENTS is two books in one. Open it from one side, and it provides parents with 201 questions for their children intended to spark discussion, help reveal who their children really are, and help children think about themselves and the world in new and useful ways. Turn it over, and there are 201 questions children can ask back to their parents. Devised as an interactive "game," this is a book that can get any family talking-really talking about facts and fears and attitudes.An ingenious book that speaks to both parents and their kids. 201 QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR KIDS/201 QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR PARENTS is two books in one.

<Summary>Meet Dr. Shelley Green – newly minted pediatrician. After graduating medical school at the top of her class, Shelley is hired by Madison Pediatrics, the Upper East Side’s most exclusive practice. Suddenly this self-described ‘schlumpy girl from Jackson Heights’ is thrown into the world of the rich, famous, and very neurotic. Her life is about to change in a big way. Hyper-parenting has reached epidemic proportions -- and Madison Pediatrics is its over-privileged epicenter. Shelley, a superb doctor with a kid-friendly touch and a genius for diagnosis, quickly becomes the Upper East Side’s latest must-have accessory, the darling of the fabulously-wealthy-with-kids crowd. Now she’s slimming down, dressing up in Fendi and Prada, and weekending in the Hamptons. No wonder Arthur – her adorable schoolteacher fiancé – is baffled. Enter Josh Potter – blueblood hunk who never seems to have his checkbook around. What he does have is charm, connections, and enough sex appeal to set Shelley’s head spinning. Before long, Shelley’s plate is way too full: men and medicine, elite nursery schools and rooftop swimming pools. Can she handle it all without losing her soul? Find out in this delicious dose of fiction that brims with acerbic wit, dead-on satire, and finally, poignancy and heart.</Summary>
