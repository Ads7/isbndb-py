<Summary>Candace Bushnell made her reputation as the creator of the HBO special Sex and the City, based on her book of the same name (based in turn on her eros-intensive New York Observer column). In Four Blondes, she returns with a quartet of novellas on her favorite subject--the mating habits of wealthy sex-, status-, and media-obsessed New Yorkers. These are people for whom a million or two does not make one rich, and who consider Louis Vuitton and Prada bare necessities. Janey Wilcox, for example, is a former model who each summer chooses a house in the Hamptons--or, rather, picks up a wealthy man with a pricey rental. With one movie in her past, her "lukewarm celebrity was established and she figured out pretty quickly that it could get her things and keep on getting them, as long as she maintained her standards." Yet even Janey eventually realizes that what she's getting isn't exactly what she wants. Cecelia, on the other hand, has gotten the ultimate prize: a royal husband. Still, she finds herself descending into paranoia as the Manhattan media circus reports her every flaw. Then there's Winnie Diekes, a high-powered magazine columnist whose marriage flounders as she pushes her unambitious husband to write the book that will make him--and her--famous. Finally, in the most clearly autobiographical story, a writer gives up on the commitment-impaired men of New York and goes to London to find a husband. There she trolls for the typical Englishman--"a guy who had sex with his socks on, possessed a microscopic willy, and came in two minutes." Bushnell is famous for this sort of sexual brashness, and the book is full of her sharp wit, both in and out of the boudoir. She also clearly enjoys her characters and their misadventures, with one exception: the politically correct Winnie, with her distaste for alcohol, night life, and casual sex, inspires an odd sort of authorial contempt. Otherwise, though, Bushnell's ironic takes on the sexual foibles of the rich and famous are mordant, mischievous fun. --Lesley Reed</Summary>

<Summary>50 Sure Ways for a Girl to Stay Single is a guidebook that's helpful in a number of critical situations. For example, if you want to end that desperate loser's crush on you, employ these shrewd strategies: o Never shave. o Chew with your mouth open. o Chain smoke. If your clueless friend just can't understand why her relationships don't last, slip this book into her bag and hope she recognizes herself in these classic gems: o Never even try to pay the bill. o Use "I don't know" as an answer for everything. o Bring up your ex as often as possible. o Always put men down. If you're fed up with the whole dating scene and need a good laugh about it, have a giggle over these wicked scenarios: o Keep staring at his "package" and then sigh repeatedly as if disappointed. o Give him a detailed description of the sex dream you had about his best friend. o Tape over his porn with Touched by an Angel. Each piece of advice is illustrated with the author's own stylized, sophisticated but slightly silly artwork, which makes the book even funnier. 50 Sure Ways for a Girl to Stay Single is goofy yet hip with great visual and comic appeal.</Summary>

<Summary>From the Publisher Your Husband doesn't understand the unbeatable combination of girlfriends and a kitchen table. Your brother doesn't have a clue about those hideous little pink lines that happen when your lipstick bleeds. And your boyfriend will never know the value of thing before responding. Let's face it - women just get it. Lorraine Bodger celebrates this divine feminine sense with 511 Things Only Women Understand. Covering everything form men and shopping to best friends and chocolate, these hilarious female truisms will have you laughing in recognition. What else do women understand? That friends are generous and invaluable sources of information about everything form soup stock to stock tips. The importance of inventing a few spicy details to make the story better. That the most important sex organ is the brain. That having many, many, many pairs of shoes does not make you a foot fetishist.</Summary>

<Summary>Those familiar with Laura Corn's other sexy sizzlers--101 Nights of Grrreat Sex, 101 Nights of Grrreat Romance, and 101 Grrreat Quickies--will need no introduction to 52 Invitations to Grrreat Sex. Those who are new to her steamy plan to heat up your sex life will want to know that this book is filled with 26 invitations for him and 26 invitations for her--a year's worth of ideas for how to put some passion into your love life. Each page in this book is actually a sealed invitation. The red ones are for her to open in private and send to her partner. The black ones are for him to send to her. Look through the titles of the invites--including "Kinky Kisses" and "Invitation to Sin"--to find one whose title appeals to you. After you've picked the one you want to use to tantalize your mate, pull the page from the book and crack the seal. Inside you'll find instructions for you, including all the necessary ingredients, plus the invitation to send to your partner. Symbols on the outside clue you to props you'll need--some of these require a bit of money, but others require nothing but a few easily found objects (such as candles) and a willingness to please. Sprinkled with quotes (such as Henry Kissinger's "Nobody will ever win the battles of the sexes. There's too much fraternizing with the enemy"), these invitations are at the same time fun and incredibly erotic. Be warned, though--they're not for the faint of heart!</Summary>
