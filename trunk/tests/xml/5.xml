   <Summary>It is New Year's Eve in Dublin, 1959. On the rooftop of 44 Seville Place, ten-year-old Peter Sheridan clings to the steel rod of a television antenna. When his father urges him to turn the antenna toward England, the boy reaches up, and pictures from a foreign place beam into their living room. Life in the Sheridan family will never be the same again.As the 1960s unfold, the Sheridans experience all the decade has to offer: sex, the Beatles, drugs, and The Troubles in Belfast. One of the best-known figures in Irish contemporary theater, Peter Sheridan recounts these hilarious, awkward, and heartbreaking years with exquisite timing and dramatic precision. Honest, sharp-witted, and compassionate, 44: Dublin Made Me draws us into this loving family as we explore the Dublin that shaped this young boy."Seldom has the blossoming of artistic passion been so effectively captured . . . it will get into your brain and your blood and stay there a long time."--San Francisco Chronicle"Peter Sheridan writes at the crossroads where hilarity and heartbreak, tenderness and savagery meet. The people who live there are often cruel, often magnificent, and always, always human. He captures them perfectly."--Roddy Doyle, author of Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha and A Star Called Henry"Sharp, jazzy, hilarious, and often painful . . . You'll rejoice in this wild song of a book."--Frank McCourt 44 was short-listed for The Irish Times Irish Literature Prize for Nonfiction</Summary>

   <Summary>Singles, 45s, 7-inchers-they have many names, but come in only one package: a square of folded cardboard with a miniature poster on either side. The gold standard of Top 40 playlists for some four decades after their introduction in 1949, these small albums have long been the favorites of DJs and collectors, who prize them for their genius of small-scale graphic design. 45 RPM is the first ever collection of 7-inch sleeves. Organized chronologically, it juxtaposes more than 200 albums, from all genres of music, chosen for their inventive design. It includes albums by such legendary artists as Paul Anka, the Beatles, the Boston Pops, the Clash, Donovan, Dizzy Gillespie, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dean Martin, Curtis Mayfield, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, the Ramones, REM, the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols, Frank Sinatra, Talking Heads, and many others. Music historian Chuck Granata provides a general introduction to the history of the 45, its place in the music business, and the designers who created the covers. Each decade of design is introduced by a specialist in that period: Eric Kohler on the 1950s, Spencer Drate on the 1960s, Roger Dean (designer of the acclaimed albums for the band Yes) on the 1970s, Bob Grossweiner on the 1980s, and Art Chantry on the 1990s and contemporary design.</Summary>

   <Summary>Candace Bushnell made her reputation as the creator of the HBO special Sex and the City, based on her book of the same name (based in turn on her eros-intensive New York Observer column). In Four Blondes, she returns with a quartet of novellas on her favorite subject--the mating habits of wealthy sex-, status-, and media-obsessed New Yorkers. These are people for whom a million or two does not make one rich, and who consider Louis Vuitton and Prada bare necessities. Janey Wilcox, for example, is a former model who each summer chooses a house in the Hamptons--or, rather, picks up a wealthy man with a pricey rental. With one movie in her past, her "lukewarm celebrity was established and she figured out pretty quickly that it could get her things and keep on getting them, as long as she maintained her standards." Yet even Janey eventually realizes that what she's getting isn't exactly what she wants. Cecelia, on the other hand, has gotten the ultimate prize: a royal husband. Still, she finds herself descending into paranoia as the Manhattan media circus reports her every flaw. Then there's Winnie Diekes, a high-powered magazine columnist whose marriage flounders as she pushes her unambitious husband to write the book that will make him--and her--famous. Finally, in the most clearly autobiographical story, a writer gives up on the commitment-impaired men of New York and goes to London to find a husband. There she trolls for the typical Englishman--"a guy who had sex with his socks on, possessed a microscopic willy, and came in two minutes." Bushnell is famous for this sort of sexual brashness, and the book is full of her sharp wit, both in and out of the boudoir. She also clearly enjoys her characters and their misadventures, with one exception: the politically correct Winnie, with her distaste for alcohol, night life, and casual sex, inspires an odd sort of authorial contempt. Otherwise, though, Bushnell's ironic takes on the sexual foibles of the rich and famous are mordant, mischievous fun. --Lesley Reed</Summary>

   <Summary>This exciting book documents the complete decade-by-decade story of one of the worldÕs most important and influential electric guitars. The Gibson Les Paul turns 50 years old in 2002, and since its invention, its sweet, urgent sound has been used by a host of major rock players - from Eric Clapton in Cream to Steve Jones of The Sex Pistols, from Joe Walsh in The Eagles to Slash of Guns NÕRoses. Unique color photographs feature a multitude of luscious Les Paul models and highlight great players in action with their Les Paul guitars. Meticulous listings for the collector document every model produced from 1952 to the present day. 50 Years of the Gibson Les Paul is a beautiful, detailed examination of six decades of great guitars and the fine musicians inspired to play them.</Summary>

   <Summary>Those familiar with Laura Corn's other sexy sizzlers--101 Nights of Grrreat Sex, 101 Nights of Grrreat Romance, and 101 Grrreat Quickies--will need no introduction to 52 Invitations to Grrreat Sex. Those who are new to her steamy plan to heat up your sex life will want to know that this book is filled with 26 invitations for him and 26 invitations for her--a year's worth of ideas for how to put some passion into your love life. Each page in this book is actually a sealed invitation. The red ones are for her to open in private and send to her partner. The black ones are for him to send to her. Look through the titles of the invites--including "Kinky Kisses" and "Invitation to Sin"--to find one whose title appeals to you. After you've picked the one you want to use to tantalize your mate, pull the page from the book and crack the seal. Inside you'll find instructions for you, including all the necessary ingredients, plus the invitation to send to your partner. Symbols on the outside clue you to props you'll need--some of these require a bit of money, but others require nothing but a few easily found objects (such as candles) and a willingness to please. Sprinkled with quotes (such as Henry Kissinger's "Nobody will ever win the battles of the sexes. There's too much fraternizing with the enemy"), these invitations are at the same time fun and incredibly erotic. Be warned, though--they're not for the faint of heart!</Summary>
