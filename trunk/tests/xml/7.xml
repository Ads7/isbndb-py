   <Summary>Struggling writer Leif Ueland has hit rock bottom: no job, no money, no decent apartment, no girlfriend, and he's also a really nice guy. Acutely insecure, he's been trying to get a grip on things with the help of a mentoring therapist. Then the opportunity of a lifetime arrives: Playboy's Playmate of the Millennium search. Dozens of cities. Thousands of women. And one man covering it all. Suddenly, Leif, a son in a family of feminists, the anti-Hefner, finds himself at the center of a vortex of erotica, sexual harrassment, plastic surgery, stripping, and, always, beautiful women. But what does it mean to be a heterosexual, single guy? Sensitivity to women's needs? A life full of machismo and meaningless sex? Leif Ueland is about to find out-and tell all.</Summary>

   <Summary>This book is about war, as waged by the ultra Liberals and the far Left and about the insidious propaganda tidal wave they have launched. This book is about the hype and scare stories on the environment and climate change, issues that are extremely difficult for the average citizen to assess. Everyday we are besieged with thousands of messages. TV is terrible. Magazines are particularly egregious, stuck in the face of every housewife and teenager at every check out station in the country. These offer secrets on everything: looks, stress, sex, health, environment, etc. In addition you are given a one-sided message about each new issue, namely that big government is the answer. And the press usually provides unlimited, un-researched and un-skeptical support. Serving as a shill for such issues is not journalism. It is a corruption of the profession. It is prostitution, a selling out of the values of honest journalism for the adoration of the so-called elite, and the hope of ultimately becoming one of these so-called elite.</Summary>

   <Summary>A different kind of serial killer is terrorizing the city of Santa Fe. All of the victims have one thing in common: they were violent sex offenders who slipped through the cracks in the justice system, and walked on legal technicalities. Someone has decided to make them pay. Forensic psychologist Dr. Sylvia Strange is called upon to help catch the killer, even if she has mixed feelings about the victims. She must uncover the pain of a madman -- pain that has driven him over the edge and into the depths of sadistic retribution. But Sylvia soon draws the attentions of the vigilante, who decides that anyone who tries to stop justice must be dealt with as any other criminal -- with a sentence of death. Includes exciting excerpts from Sarah Lovett's thrillers featuring Dr. Sylvia Strange: Dangerous Attachments, A Desperate Silence, Dantes' Inferno and her lastest hardcover, Dark Alchemy, coming soon from Simon and Schuster</Summary>

   <Summary>The categories of "whore" and "actress" have overlapped over centuries. Actresses are assumed to be sexually available and promiscuous, and prostitutes are assumed to perform for their clients. Employing historical biographies as well as interviews with contemporary sex workers, this book compares actresses and prostitutes from Nell Gwynne to Mae West. Ranging from the seventeenth century to the present, Kirsten Pullen offers many new insights to theater historians and scholars of cultural, social and gender studies.</Summary>
