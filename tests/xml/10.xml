   <Summary>Advances in Brain Vasopressin elucidates the functions of the regulatory peptide vasopressin in the nervous system, and reviews the current status of this field at different levels.It deals with the cell biology and anatomy of the neurons that produce vasopressin in the brain, and provides an overview on the receptors of vasopressin and the signal transduction pathways that they activate, including the cellular responses that are triggered by vasopressin. Reviews are presented on the modulation of behavior induced by vasopressin in a number of different contexts, such as sex-linked and steroid-dependent behaviors, social behaviors, and learning and memory.Furthermore, the volume deals with several controversial issues in the field by presenting overlapping chapters from different research groups in order to provide the reader with current views.Highly relevant and useful, for those working on this "first" neuropeptide, and for young investigators entering the field, and in addition, shows how important a multidisciplinary approach is to unravelling the function of a neuropeptide in the brain.</Summary>

   <Summary>Advances in Genetics increases its focus on modern human genetics and its relation to medicine with the merger of this long-standing serial with Molecular Genetic Medicine. This merger affirms the Academic Press commitment to publish important reviews of the broadest interest to geneticists and their colleagues in affiliated disciplines.Genetics, the science of heredity, lies at the heart of biology, and many diseases are impacted by an individuals genetic make-up. The field of genetics is rapidly evolving and new medical break-throughs are occurring as a result of advances in knowledge of genetics. Advances in Genetics continually publishes important reviews of the broadest interest to geneticists and their colleagues in affiliated disciplines. This volume of Advances in Genetics contains the following articles: Targeted Expression of Tetanus Toxin; Germ-line Transformants Spreading Out to Many Insect Species; Genes Mediating Sex-Specific Behaviors in Drosophila; and Evolutionary Analyses of Genes and Their Functional Implications.</Summary>

   <Summary>Charlotte Arkendale knew all there was to know about men. After all, she'd made a career out of steering marriage-minded women away from untrustworthy members of the opposite sex.Yet nothing could have prepared her for Baxter St. Ives--an arresting stranger too daring, too determined, too dangerous to be her new man-of-affairs. Still, perhaps he was the perfect person to help Charlotte investigate the recent murder of one of her clients. So she gave him a chance, never realizing that Baxter, a gifted scientist, would soon conduct a risky exploration into the alchemy of desire, with Charlotte as his subject.But even as he sets out to seduce Charlotte, a twisted killer lies in wait, ready to part the lovers...or see them joined together forever--in death.</Summary>

   <Summary>Regency writer Amanda Quick is one of romance's greatest authors for a reason: she can manipulate even the most discerning reader. In Affair, she takes the most unlikely hero, a nondescript, scientific nerd, and a bastard, and turns him into one of the most desirable "to-die-for heroes" ever. Of course, as the reader, you feel that you (and the heroine) are the only ones in on this fabulous secret. Of course, there's a great plot, great sex, and a happy ending, too! Don't miss this one!</Summary>
