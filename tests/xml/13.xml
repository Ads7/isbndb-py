<Summary>"A SKILLFUL BLEND OF CHARACTER, PHILOSOPHY AND NARRATIVE. . .Formidable personalities embroil themselves in ruthless power struggles that would make a corporate raider blush."--The Washington Post Book WorldIt is 1965, and Charles Ashworth has attained the plum position of bishop of Starbridge, an honor that keeps him in a heady whirl of activity that would exhaust the most seasoned corporate executive. With the invaluable support of his minions and his attractive, unsinkable wife, Ashworth stands against the amorality and decadence of the age--"Anti-Sex Ashworth." He slays his opponents by being a tough, efficient, confident churchman, the torments of his past long since dead and buried.And then the unexpected, the unthinkable, strikes.Suddenly Ashworth finds himself staring into the chasm of all the lies hes been telling himself for years: about his marriage, his children, even his views on the Church. And as he suspects his old nemesis and dean, Neville Aysgarth, of drinking too much, of financial chicanery, of--God forbid--having an affair, Ashworth discovers to his horror that he is tempted to commit the very acts that he has so publicly denounced. . . ."ENTHRALLING. . .Rich, dense, almost indecently entertaining."--San Jose Mercury News"POWERFUL. . .MIRACULOUS."--Booklist (starred review)SELECTED BY THE BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUBFrom the Paperback edition.</Summary>

<Summary>An ex-president crashes into an elderly pedestrian while driving drunk. A congressman beats a colleague senseless in the Capitol building. A presidential candidate dares the press to expose his affair and is promptly exposed. A district attorney prosecutes himself at taxpayer's expense. You might be surprised to find that none of this is fiction. These are all actions by individuals voted into our public institutions. In this book, authors Hakeem Shittu and Callie Query meticulously chronicle these tales of adultery, deception, drugs, murder, sex, stupidity, theft and treason as practiced by American politicians. The nonpartisan effort spans the formative days of the republic through recent times, relentlessly exposing political misdeeds and misquotes along the way. The result is sure to evoke laughter, shock, and amazement at the antics of those "esteemed" individuals that we elect to our public offices.</Summary>

<Summary>Struggling writer Leif Ueland has hit rock bottom: no job, no money, no decent apartment, no girlfriend, and he's also a really nice guy. Acutely insecure, he's been trying to get a grip on things with the help of a mentoring therapist. Then the opportunity of a lifetime arrives: Playboy's Playmate of the Millennium search. Dozens of cities. Thousands of women. And one man covering it all. Suddenly, Leif, a son in a family of feminists, the anti-Hefner, finds himself at the center of a vortex of erotica, sexual harrassment, plastic surgery, stripping, and, always, beautiful women. But what does it mean to be a heterosexual, single guy? Sensitivity to women's needs? A life full of machismo and meaningless sex? Leif Ueland is about to find out-and tell all.</Summary>

<Summary>The debut novel of a formidable fictional talent.An improbable coincidence brings Clare back into contact with someone she once had sex with as a teenager; to complicate matters, he is now going out with her best friend, Helly. The encounter could have just been embarrassing, but it shakes up everything in Clare’s life. Clare and Helly learned to smoke and shoplift together, and even read an old copy of The Female Eunuch together, squeezed side by side on Helly’s bed. Now Clare is married with three small children, bakes her own bread and buys her clothes from the charity shop. Helly is a model and has her image up on billboards ten feet high. And each of them seems to want what the other has.</Summary>
