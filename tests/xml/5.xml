<Summary>A valuable reference work. The trusted resource. Still. This annual, up-to-date, comprehensive guide to the Catholic Church has been the reference work to which students, teachers, researchers, homilists, writers, and media professionals have turned for more than 100 years. This is the resource on which they have relied for solid, orthodox Catholic teaching and information. This is the reference work with the in-depth index that makes it easy to find specific, exact information. This is the resource endorsed by Archbishop John Foley, President of the Pontifical Council on Social Communication at the Vatican, who writes: "It is an annual masterpiece!" Topics in the 2005 edition include:  The Year in Review  Special Reports on Same-Sex Unions, the Sex Abuse Scandal, Catholics in Political Life, and Pope John Paul II's 25th Anniversary  Coverage of the new document on Catholic Devotions  Update on Partial-Birth Abortion and other Life Issues  Biographies of the New Cardinals  Full Coverage of Mother Teresa's Beatification  Biographies of all new Saints and Blesseds  Updates on Papal Travel  Updated National and World Statistics  Updated Statistics on Men and Women Religious  Catholic Social Teachings  Mary  Canon Law  Glossary of Catholic Terms  Church Calendar  Scripture  Liturgy  Sacraments  Chronologies of U.S. and World Church History  Coverage on the rules for Papal Conclaves  Ecumenism  Encyclicals And more! "Our Sunday Visitor claims this work is the `one and only Catholic resource' and it is `simply the best annual guide to the Catholic Church anywhere.' These are bold statements, but accurate . . . This excellent work is especially useful for those interested in either the Roman Catholic Church or the Holy See . . . It is informative, easy to use, and well written."  American Reference Books Manual, 2003.</Summary>

<Summary>From the pages of The New Yorker, The New York Times, and Slate stagger Frank Cammuso and Hart Seely, restoring a cheerful sanity to our deranged lives and times.Every now and then, funny writing somehow manages to retain full possession of literary quality. Please see Twain, Heller, Benchley, Parker, Frazier, Geng. And now please see Cammuso and Seely. If you're not some famous person in our hyped, commodified, three-screen (movie, TV, computer), celeb-ridden society, count your blessings. Because if you are, Cammuso and Seely will probably get you sooner or later. They got Martha Stewart--they have her planning gracious plans for her version of the Son of God's final repast: "Jesus has indicated--against my better wishes--that He intends to gird Himself with a towel and wash everybody's feet. So be it. But beforehand, I'll run his terry cloth for five minutes in the dryer, making it toasty and soft." They (fondly) postu-late how Phil Rizzuto might have written a characteristically fractionated version of "Casey at the Bat": "'Fraud!' cried the maddened thousands, and the echo murmured 'Fraud.' / Hey, Murcer! Look! Bea Arthur! Didn't she play Maude?" The Flintstones become the Clintstones, Quentin Tarantino directs The Three Little Pigs, and Dr. Seuss collaborates poetically with Rod Serling.Even when the targets of these pieces are of the moment, Cammuso and Seely's humor will endure. What's more evanescent than pop-music stardom? Sex, maybe, but not much else. But who won't laugh, even years from now, as Cammuso and Seely--in "Six Degrees of Chuck Berry"--introduce some of the record industry's often interchangeable personages to each other: "Tanya, Enya. Enya, Shania. Shania, Mariah. Mariah, Wynonna. Wynonna, Fiona . . . " Nobody.From the Hardcover edition.</Summary>
